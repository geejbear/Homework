- exactly one measure per line, the first note of the measure is the first note on the line, the last is the last

- always a space between notes regardless of whatever stuff is attached to them, e.g ties

- all stuff attached to notes is consecutive, no spaces - es,8([~

you can:
\repeat unfold 4 { r8 c,8( c') c c c }

which acts as a sort of for loop in:

    r8 c,8( c') c c c 
    r8 c,8( c') c c c 
    r8 c,8( c') c c c 
    r8 c,8( c') c c c 

- leave comments with bar numbers e.g %50

Use on a single voice to do a double line repreat
\repeat volta 2 {
}

- use [ ] instead of \autoBeam
